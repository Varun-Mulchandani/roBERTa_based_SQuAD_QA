Question Answering has become one of the most important problems in modern NLP research. In this project, I have tried to implement a Q and A system using Facebook's roBERTa, fine-tuned on SQuAD_2.0(Stanford Question and Answering Dataset)

# Tools:

Tensorflow(v2.1.0)

Keras(v3.0)

Huggingface's Transformer library
(Note : Huggingface does not have a question and answering head for RoBERTa in Tensorflow. I have used a custom QA_head in this projet which will be described with the architecture)

Huggingface's Tokenizer library
Numpy

Pandas

Sklearn
